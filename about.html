		Welcome, folks!
	</h1>
	<p>
		If you are here, you're probably interested in the cosmos, stars, dark matter, and existential questions like: "<small>white spaces</small> or <b>tabs</b>?"<br><br>
		Joking aside, just as the definition suggests, this BLOG is an archive of my thoughts, problems encountered during my work (and maybe their solutions), and everything I'm interested in that I would like to share â€” maybe something useful for you. &#128521;<br><br>

		Feel free to fill out the <a href="contact.html" title="Go to contacts">form</a> if you have any questions, feedback, or wish to report a mistake. Thank you!
