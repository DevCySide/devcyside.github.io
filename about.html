		Welcome, folks!

	<p>
		If you are here, you're probably interested in the cosmos, stars, dark matter, and existential questions like: "<small>white spaces</small> or <b>tabs</b>?"<br><br>
		Joking aside, just as the definition suggests, this BLOG is an archive of my thoughts, problems encountered during my work (and maybe their solutions), and everything I'm interested in that I would like to share â€” maybe something useful for you. &#128521;<br><br>
